# Stock-Trend-Predictor
This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict stock market trends using historical stock price data. It leverages a pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model built using Keras to analyze patterns in closing prices and generate predictions.

The application fetches real-time stock data using the yFinance API, processes it using pandas and NumPy, and visualizes trends through matplotlib plots. Users can enter any stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple) and view historical price data, moving averages, and the model's predictions, all in an interactive web interface.

This tool is useful for anyone interested in understanding market behavior, exploring time-series predictions, or building finance-related ML apps. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of combining machine learning, data visualization, and web deployment using Python.
